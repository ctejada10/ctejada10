### Hola! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a consultant at Netcompany, based in beautiful Copenhagen, Denmark. I hold a
PhD in Computer Science from the University of Copenhagen. My current work
focuses on using machine inteligence to help automate processes in the Danish
public sector.

My PhD dissertation explores what I call Print-and-Play Fabrication: a future
where interactive objects are printed rather than assembled. These interactive
objects would be ready to use immediately after fabrication, without any extra
effort from the designer. By fabricating interactive objects with little-to-no
post-print activities required, makers, designers, educators, and hobbyists can
transform any passive fabricated object into an interactive artifact. Doing so
has the possibility of enriching areas like accessibility, education, and
entertainment. You can read more about it
