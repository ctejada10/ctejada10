### Hola! ðŸ‘‹

I am postdoctoral researcher at the University of Washington, where I
investigate how to make computer-aided design (CAD) software more accessible to
blind and low-vision users. 

I hold a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Copenhagen, where my
dissertation introduced the concept of Print-and-Play Fabricationâ€” a future
where interactive objects are printed rather than assembled. These interactive
objects would be ready to use immediately after fabrication, without any extra
effort from the designer. By fabricating interactive objects with little-to-no
post-print activities required, makers, designers, educators, and hobbyists can
transform any passive fabricated object into an interactive artifact. Doing so
has the possibility of enriching areas like accessibility, education, and
entertainment. You can read more about it
