### Hola! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD Student at the Department of Computer Science at the University of
Copenhagen, focusing on employing sensing and machine learning technologies
to enable interactivity to 3D-printed objects without any post-print assembly
or calibration.

My research explores what I call _Print-and-Play fabrication_: a future where
interactive objects are printed instead of assembled. These interactive
objects would be ready to use immediately after fabrication, without any
extra effort from the designer. By fabricating interactive objects with
little-to-no post-print activities required, makers, designers, educators,
and hobbyists can transform any passive fabricated object into an interactive
artifact. Doing so has the possibility of enriching areas like accessibility,
education, and entertainment.

I am advised by [Dr. Daniel Ashbrook](www.danielashbrook.com) at the Future
Everyday Technology Research Laboratory.
